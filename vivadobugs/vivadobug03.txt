Vivado produces incorrect results for the following Verilog code:

	module top(input [2:0] a, output y);
		assign y = a != 1'bx;
	endmodule

Run "vivadobug03.sh" for synthesis, and pre- and post-synthesis simulation.

Pre-synthesis simulation results:

	a=010, y=1

Post-synthesis simulation results:

	a=010, y=0

Vivado sets "y = 0" for this design. It seems like Vivado thinks that the result
of a comparison with 1'bx is undefined. This is of course wrong. The value 1'bx
has to be zero extended to 3'b00x, and the comparison has to return "1" if the
operands differ in any of the non-x bits.

This bug has been reproduced with Vivado 2016.4 and 2017.1.

This issue has been reported as Xilinx SR 10394726 and CR 975241.
