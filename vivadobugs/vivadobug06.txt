The following design should output a="a" and b="b". However, there seems to be
a bug in Vivado Synthesis and a similar bug in XSIM that causes the tools to
stop processing the adata string at the zero byte (i.e. interpretation as "C
string") which causes the design to output a="\000" and b="b" in simulation and
synthesis instead.

	module top(output [7:0] a, b);
		localparam [15:0] adata = "a\000";
		localparam [15:0] bdata = "b\001";
		assign a = adata[15:8], b = bdata[15:8];
	endmodule

I'm using Vivado 2017.2 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

Note that this is a bug report, not a support request. Please verify that the
behavior is as described and that this behavior is in vialoation of IEEE Std 1364
and create a CR accordingly.
