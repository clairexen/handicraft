Vivado HLS includes the wrong gmp.h in cosim mode

Vivado HLS comes with its own version of "gmp.h". However, during cosim Vivado
HLS incorrectly preferrs header files from the system include directories over
the headers in /opt/Xilinx/Vivado_HLS/2017.1/include/. Because of that, when
running Vivado HLS on Ubuntu 16.04 with libgmp-dev installed, every HLS project
that includes <ap_fixed.h> will fail with something like the following error
during cosim:

The attached project demontrates this. Simply install libgmp-dev and then run
vivado_hls (on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS):

	sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev
	/opt/Xilinx/Vivado_HLS/2017.1/bin/vivado_hls -f vivadobug04.tcl

Work-arounds: Either uninstall libgmp-dev or manually #include
"/opt/Xilinx/Vivado_HLS/2017.1/include/gmp.h" before including any
headers that #include <gmp.h>. 

This bug has been reproduced with Vivado 2016.4 and 2017.1.

Please note that this is a bug report. I don't need support. Please verify the
existence of the bug and create a CR so this is going to be fixed in a future
release of Vivado HLS.

This issue has been reported as Xilinx SR 10395072.
