The attached simple TCL script produces an "internal application error" when
run in GUI mode. Running the same script in "batch" or "tcl" mode works fine.

I.e. run the following command to reproduce the issue:

	vivado -source vivadobug05.tcl

After a short while a window pops up with the following error message:

The following two commands do not produce any errors. This is not surprising as
the call trace above indicates that the error is related to the GUI code.

	vivado -mode batch -source vivadobug05.tcl
	vivado -mode tcl -source vivadobug05.tcl
