FizzBuzz Verilog Challange
==========================

Create a Verilog module that outputs at least the first 10000 lines of FizzBuzz
(ASCII text, decimal numbers), strictly one byte per cycle (no idle cycles).

This directory contains a pre-synthesized reference implementation and a simple
test bench. (Note: The test bench does not check the output, just write it to
stdout. You have to check externally if the output is correct.)
