This directory contains a small example for using emscripten in a web worker.
The example calulates the sum and product of an array of integers in the C++
environment. It is ment to be used as a template for offloading expensive
calculations to an emscripten-based web worker.

Note: You will need to open this via a local web server because the security
model for file:// URLs does not allow launching the web worker.


Makefile
~~~~~~~~

builds emscripten (emcc) and example.js

warning: building emscripten will take a while, depending
on the speed of your machine.

example.cc
~~~~~~~~~~

this is the file we compile to javascript

in this example I am already using the newer "embind"
mechanism to create bindings between javascript and c++.

worker.js
~~~~~~~~~

a small javascript worker that calls the c code on incoming
messages and sends the (modified) request object back.

demo.html
~~~~~~~~~

a very simple web-app that is using the emscripten based
worker.
