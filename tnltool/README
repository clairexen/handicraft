tnltool - Transistor Netlist Tool
=================================

tnltool is a program that reads in an architecture description of a
semiconductor architecture utilizing switching transistors (node states,
transistor description and state transition tables) as well as a netlist
and generates C code that can be used to simulate and analyze the circuit.

This project contains an a complete model of a 6502 that is generated using
the netlists from the visual6502 project (http://visual6502.org/).
