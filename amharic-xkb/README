The Challange:
==============

Configure X11 in a way so the user can switch between english/german keyboard
mapping and amharic and use the amharic composition characters without
destroying the english/german layout.


The Solution:
=============

cp xcompose.txt $HOME/.XCompose
sudo cp et.txt /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/et

sudo rm -fv /var/lib/xkb/*.xkm

setxkbmap -layout us,de,et


The Cheatsheet:
===============

A nice table with all the compositons can be found in chartab.html.

(It can be re-generated with 'splrun gentable.spl < xcompose.txt  > chartab.html'.)
