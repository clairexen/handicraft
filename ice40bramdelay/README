When programmed using SRAM programming, the iCE40 BRAM reads incorrect (i.e.
zero) data for the first few cycles after reset. The issue seems to go away
when programming the same bit-stream a second time. This simple design
demonstrates this issue.

Note: When building with iCEcube2, make sure you synthesize with LSE and set
the "Propagate Constants" option to False. Otherwise iCEcube2 will (incorrectly)
optimize the design away.
