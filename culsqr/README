Just some experiments with the CuSPARSE library.

If the incomplete preconditioners where doing complete factorizations, this
would actually solve linear least squares problems..

The purpose of this demo was just to make sure I understood the CuSPARSE data
structures and have managed successfully to use the API. All calculations have
been checked against GNU Octave and it seams like everything is doing what it
should be doing.
