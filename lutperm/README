Functions to calculate the LUT init value bit permutations that correspond to
swapping input pins on the LUT.

See lutperm.cc:

perm_lut(): Implementation using bext and bdep operations. Constant time on
architectures that provide instructions for those operations.

perm_lut_naive(): naive implementation based on resampling of the original LUT.
