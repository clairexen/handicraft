Reference implementation of Keccak-f[1600] (SHA-3, SHAKE) optimized for RV64B
(RISC-V 64 bit with B-extension) using ROT-Immediate and AND-Complement.

This implementation of Keccak-p requires 28 64-bit registers, i.e. all RISC-V
registers except zero, sp, gp, and tp. 25 of those registers are used to hold
the 1600-bit state and 3 registers are used as temporaries. We also need 5
words on the stack.

This implementation executes 145 instructions per round (Keccak-p is one round,
Keccak-f is 24 rounds for SHA-3). The exact instruction mix is as follows.

     1    0.7%   AUIPC
     1    0.7%   MV
     5    3.5%   SD
     8    5.5%   LD
    25   17.2%   ANDC
    29   20.0%   ROLI
    76   52.4%   XOR

This corresponds to the following instructions-per-byte payload (IPB) numbers
for the different SHA-3 instances:

    Instance   Block size    IPB

    SHA3-224   144 Bytes    24.2
    SHA3-256   136 Bytes    25.6
    SHA3-384   104 Bytes    33.5
    SHA3-512    72 Bytes    48.3
