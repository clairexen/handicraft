# Trading Apples

## Problem Statement
Alice has nine apples. Bob has six apples. Alice eats one apple, and then trades half
of her remaining apples with Bob, for a toy. Bob then eats one third of his apples.
How many apples has Bob left?

## Analysis
- The problem statement is easy to understand and requires no rephrasing.
- The problem is simple enough to be solved in a single step.

## Solution
- Alice (A) has 9 apples. Bob (B) has 5 apples.
[ A' := 9 ] 9=9
[ B' := 5 ] 5=5
[ next. ] A=9, B=5
- Alice (A) eats 1 apple.
[ A' := A-1 ] 9-1=8
[ next. ] A=8, B=5
- Alice (A) trades 1/2 of her apples with Bob (B).
[ A' := A - A/2 ] 8-8/2=8-4=4
[ B' := B + A/2 ] 5+8/2=5+4=9
[ next. ] A=4, B=9
- Bob (B) eats 1/3 of his apples.
[ B' := B - B/3 ] 9-9/3=9-3=6
[ next. ] A=4, B=6
- How many apples has Bob left?
[ B. ] 6

## Answer
Bob has six apples left.

# Exchanging Ballons

## Problem Statement
Alice has three ballons. Bob has seven ballons. A third person comes along and
pops three of Bobs ballons and one of Alices ballons. After that has happened,
how many ballons must Bob give to Alice, if they both want to have the same
number of ballons afterwards? How many ballons does either one of them have at
the end?

## Analysis
- The problem statement is easy to understand and requires no rephrasing.
- The problem is simple enough to be solved in a single step.

## Solution
- Alice (A) has 3 ballons. Bob (B) has 7 ballons.
[ A' := 3 ] 3=3
[ B' := 7 ] 7=7
[ next. ] A=3, B=7
- Someone pops 3 of Bobs ballons and 1 of Alices ballons.
[ A' := A-1 ] 3-1=2
[ B' := B-3 ] 7-3=4
[ next. ] A=2, B=4
- How many must Bob give to Alice, if they both want to have the same number
afterwards?
[ (B-A)/2. ] (4-2)/2=2/2=1
- What's the final state?
[ A' := A + (B-A)/2 ] 2+(4-2)/2=2+2/2=2+1=3
[ B' := B - (B-A)/2 ] 4-(4-2)/2=4-2/2=4-1=3
[ next. ] A=3, B=3

Answer:
Bob must give Alice one ballon, so that they both have three ballons at the end.

# Painting Rooms

## Problem Statement
Alice buys paint for 100 EUR. She paints the walls on her 230 cm tall 4 meter
times 5 meter room, and gives the leftover paint to Bob. It is exactly enough
paint for Bob that to paint a single 4 meter wide wall in his 255 cm room.
Assuming the same amount of paint per square meter wall in both rooms, how much
money does Bob owe to Alice, if he wants to pay her for the exact share of
the paint he was using?

## Analysis
- The problem statement is easy to understand and requires no rephrasing.
- The problem is complex enough to warrant decomposition.

## Decomposition:
(1) What's the area of the 4 painted walls in Alice's room?
(2) What's the area of the 1 painted wall in Bob's room?
(3) What's the proportional share of the money?

## Solution to (1)
- 2 walls, each 4 meter * 2.3 meter, and
- 2 walls, each 5 meter * 2.3 meter.
[ A := 2*4*2.3 + 2*5*2.3 ] 2*4*2.3+2*5*2.3=8*2.3+10*2.3=18.4+23=41.4

## Solution to (2)
- 1 wall, 4 meter * 2.55 meter.
[ B := 4*2.55 ] 4*2.55=10.2

## Solution to (3)
- Bob's share of the total money equals Bob's share of the total wall area.
[ P := B / (A+B) ] 10.2/(41.4+10.2)=10.2/51.6=0.1977
- Applied to the amount Alice paid originally.
[ 100 * P. ] 19.77

## Answer
Bob owes Alice 19.77 EUR.

# Buying Groceries

## Problem Statement
Alice goes to the market. She buys 5 liter milk for 0.7 EUR / liter and 2 kg
bread for 3 EUR / kg. Half the milk and a third of the bread are for Bob. How
much does Bob owe Alice?

## Analysis
- The problem statement is easy to understand and requires no rephrasing.
- The problem is complex enough to warrant decomposition.

## Decomposition
(1) How much does Alice pay for the milk?
(2) How much does Alice pay for the bread?
(3) How much does Bob owe Alice?

## Solution to (1)
- 5 liter milk for 0.7 EUR / liter.
[ Milk' := 5*0.7 ] 5*0.7=3.5
[ next. ] Milk=3.5

## Solution to (2)
- 2 kg bread for 3 EUR / kg.
[ Bread' := 2*3 ] 2*3=6
[ next. ] Milk=3.5, Bread=6

## Solution to (3)
- Bob owes half the milk and a third of the bread.
[ Bob' := Milk/2 + Bread/3 ] 3.5/2+6/3=1.75+2=3.75
[ next. ] Milk=3.5, Bread=6, Bob=3.75

## Answer
Bob owes Alice 3.75 EUR.

# Saving Money

## Problem Statement
Alice earns 3700 EUR per month and has 2500 EUR expenses per month. Bob earns
3000 EUR per month and has 2200 EUR expenses. If they both safe all the money they
earn after those expenses, how long will it take them to collectively have saved
15000 EUR?

## Analysis
- The problem statement is easy to understand and requires no rephrasing.
- The problem is complex enough to warrant decomposition.

## Decomposition
(1) How much money do they save per month?
(2) How long will it take them to collectively have saved 15000 EUR?

## Solution to (1)
- Alice saves 3700-2500 EUR per month.
[ A' := 3700-2500 ] 3700-2500=1200
[ next. ] A=1200
- Bob saves 3000-2200 EUR per month.
[ B' := 3000-2200 ] 3000-2200=800
[ next. ] A=1200, B=800

## Solution to (2)
- Divide the goal of 15000 EUR by their monthly savings.
[ T' := 15000 / (A+B) ] 15000/(1200+800)=15000/2000=7.5
[ next. ] A=1200, B=800, T=7.5

## Answer
It will take them 7.5 months to collectively have saved 15000 EUR.

[ A := 300 * 0.2 ] 300*0.2=60
- Bob (B) saves 50% of 500 EUR/month
[ B := 500 * 0.5 ] 500*0.5=250
- Charlie (C) saves 75% of 500 EUR/month
[ C := 500 * 0.75 ] 500*0.75=375
- How much are they saving collectively in one month?

# Calculating Discounted Milk Price

## Problem Statement
What's the prize of 20 liters milk, if the price for 1 liter is 2 EUR
and there's a 10% discount on the fraction of the volume in excess of
5 liters?

## Analysis
- The problem statement is easy to understand and requires no rephrasing.
- The problem is simple enough to be solved in a single step.

## Solution
- The total volume is 20 liters milk.
[ V := 20 ] 20
- The regular price is applied to the first 5 liters.
[ R := 5 ] 5
- The discount is applied to the excess above 5 liters.
[ D := V-R ] 20-5=15
- The regular price is 2 EUR.
[ RP := 2 ] 2
- The discount price is 10% off.
[ DP := RP - RP*0.1 ] 1.8
- The total price of R liters at RP and D liters at DP.
[ R*RP + D*DP. ] 5*2+15*1.8=10+27=37

# Answer
37 EUR for 20 liters milk, if the price for 1 liter is 2 EUR and there's a 10%
discount on the fraction of the volume in excess of 5 liters.
