.. some files from visual6502:
https://github.com/trebonian/visual6502.git
(git commit de265ecdb89d8c5d299f09ad69aaf8b87b1aed5d)

this is a stripped down and hacked up version of the original
visual6502. i just kicked it hard and long enough to provide
me with some reference data for my own simulator. if you are
interested in visual6502, go to www.visual6502.org/JSSim and
use the original simulator there..

All my changes are either marked using a comment containing
the string "[Clifford Wolf]" or can be identified by the fact
that they call the function printConsole().

------------------ original README ------------------

This is the javascript simulator from the visual5602.org project:
www.visual6502.org/JSSim

It includes a general purpose transistor-level simulator, layout browser,
and the data from a 6502 revD chip. 

Recently added: polygon data for the 6800 chip. The simulation is not yet working,
