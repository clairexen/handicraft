Let's make everything concerete for simplicity: We are working on 64 bit
words using a 6-stage (6 = log2 64) butterfly network.

Because we already have the butterfly networks in this module, we optionally
also support Generalized Reverse (grev) in the same core.

Find the implementation of the core in pdep_pext.v.

See report.txt for an analysis of area and timing for this core.
